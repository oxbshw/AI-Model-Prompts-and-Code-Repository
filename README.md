## 📝 Test Prompts

### Computational Graphics Tests

#### 🟡 Test 1: Bouncing Ball in Rotating Square
```
Write a Python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a square. 
Make sure to handle collision detection properly. Make the square 
slowly rotate. Implement it in Python. Ensure the ball stays within 
the square.
```

**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐  
**Skills Tested**: Physics simulation, collision detection, coordinate transformation  
**Expected Output**: Functional Python script with pygame or similar graphics library

---

#### 🔷 Test 2: Complex 3D Collision Detection
```
Write a script for a bouncing yellow ball within a Rhombicosidodecahedron. 
Make sure to handle collision detection properly. Make the 
Rhombicosidodecahedron slowly rotate. Ensure the ball stays within the 
Rhombicosidodecahedron. Implement it in p5.js.
```

**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Skills Tested**: 3D mathematics, complex geometry, WebGL/p5.js proficiency  
**Expected Output**: Interactive web-based 3D animation

---

### Creative Programming Tests

#### 🌀 Test 3: Dynamic Fractal Generation
```
Be creative and write Python code to generate moving fractals.
```

**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Skills Tested**: Mathematical creativity, animation, algorithm design  
**Expected Output**: Original fractal algorithms with visual output

---

### Arabic Language Tests

#### 📖 Test 4: Implicit Storytelling Challenge
```python
"""
Create a story in Modern Standard Arabic where each sentence contains 
exactly ten words. The story must convey the concept of 'time travel' 
without explicitly mentioning it. Add comments explaining how you 
ensured the word count and conveyed the concept.
"""
```

**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Skills Tested**: Arabic language mastery, creative writing, constraint satisfaction  
**Expected Output**: Creative Arabic story with analytical comments
